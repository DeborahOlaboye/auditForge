3. Front-Running Vulnerability

## Detailed Findings

### ðŸŸ  Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow [IO-01]
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Line 1
**Confidence:** 70%

**Description:**
Arithmetic operations may be vulnerable to overflow/underflow

**Technical Explanation:**
Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically check for integer overflow and underflow. Unchecked arithmetic can wrap around, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Exploit Scenario:**
An attacker could manipulate arithmetic operations to overflow/underflow values, potentially bypassing balance checks or manipulating token supplies.

**Recommendation:**
Upgrade to Solidity 0.8.0+ which has built-in overflow/underflow checking, or use SafeMath library for older versions.

**Code:**
```solidity
// Vulnerable (Solidity < 0.8.0):
uint256 balance = 0;
balance = balance - 1; // underflows to max uint256

// Fixed (Solidity >= 0.8.0):
// Automatically reverts on overflow/underflow

// Or use SafeMath:
using SafeMath for uint256;
balance = balance.sub(1); // safely reverts
```

### ðŸŸ  Missing Access Control [AC-01]
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Line 16 in function `withdraw`
**Confidence:** 90%

**Description:**
Critical function "withdraw" is public without access control

**Technical Explanation:**
Functions that modify critical contract state or handle funds should be restricted to authorized addresses only.

**Exploit Scenario:**
Any user can call withdraw() and perform privileged operations, potentially draining funds or taking over the contract.

**Recommendation:**
Add access control modifier such as "onlyOwner" or implement role-based access control.

**Code:**
```solidity
// Vulnerable:
function withdraw() public {
  // critical operation
}

// Fixed:
function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
  // critical operation
}
```

### ðŸŸ  Front-Running Vulnerability [FR-01]
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Line 11
**Confidence:** 75%

**Description:**
Price or state changes visible before execution can be front-run

**Technical Explanation:**
Detected usage of function deposit() public payable

**Exploit Scenario:**
See references for potential exploits

**Recommendation:**
Use commit-reveal scheme for sensitive operations

**Code:**
```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
```

**References:** Front-Running, MEV

### ðŸŸ¡ Floating Pragma [FP-01]
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Line 2
**Confidence:** 75%

**Description:**
Pragma version not locked to specific compiler version

**Technical Explanation:**
Detected usage of pragma solidity ^

**Exploit Scenario:**
See references for potential exploits

**Recommendation:**
Lock pragma to specific Solidity version for production contracts

**Code:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
```

**References:** SWC-103

### ðŸ”µ Missing Event Emission [EM-01]
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Line 11 in function `deposit`
**Confidence:** 50%

**Description:**
Function "deposit" modifies state but may not emit events

**Technical Explanation:**
Functions that modify state should emit events for off-chain tracking and transparency.

**Exploit Scenario:**
State changes without events make it difficult to track contract behavior and audit trails.

**Recommendation:**
Add event emission for all significant state changes.

**Code:**
```solidity
event Deposit(...);
```

**References:** Best Practice

---

### ðŸ”µ Missing Event Emission [EM-01]
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Line 16 in function `withdraw`
**Confidence:** 50%

**Description:**
Function "withdraw" modifies state but may not emit events

**Technical Explanation:**
Functions that modify state should emit events for off-chain tracking and transparency.

**Exploit Scenario:**
State changes without events make it difficult to track contract behavior and audit trails.

**Recommendation:**
Add event emission for all significant state changes.

**Code:**
```solidity
event Withdraw(...);
```

### âšª Public Function Could Be External [PE-01]
**Severity:** INFO
**Location:** Line 11 in function `deposit`
**Confidence:** 50%

**Description:**
Function "deposit" is public but could be external

**Technical Explanation:**
Functions that are not called internally can be marked as external instead of public, saving gas.

**Exploit Scenario:**
Not a security issue, but wastes gas unnecessarily.

**Recommendation:**
Change visibility from public to external if the function is not called internally.

**Code:**
```solidity
// Before:
function deposit() public { }

// After:
function deposit() external { }
```

**References:** Gas Optimization

### âšª Public Function Could Be External [PE-01]
**Severity:** INFO
**Location:** Line 27 in function `getBalance`
**Confidence:** 50%

**Description:**
Function "getBalance" is public but could be external

**Technical Explanation:**
Functions that are not called internally can be marked as external instead of public, saving gas.

**Exploit Scenario:**
Not a security issue, but wastes gas unnecessarily.

**Recommendation:**
Change visibility from public to external if the function is not called internally.

**Code:**
```solidity
// Before:
function getBalance() public { }

// After:
function getBalance() external { }
```
