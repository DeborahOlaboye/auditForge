## 🚀 How to Run

### Start the API Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Test the Audit
```bash
node test-audit.js
# Analyzes vulnerable-reentrancy.sol
# Generates test-report.md and test-report.json
```

### Open the Frontend
```bash
# Open frontend/index.html in your browser
# Make sure API server is running first
```

### Use the API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract Test {}",
    "contractName": "Test"
  }'
```
